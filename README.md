# WeatherMate
A weather browser

## Description

The website is designed to have a user input a city name into the search box, at which point the current weather and 5 day forecast will be loaded.

The purpose of the website is to provide the current and future weather to the public.

I built the website which has been beneficial in asissting with furthering my knowledge of JavaScript as well as API's.

## Usage

The Weather Browser can be loaded via any browser.  Once the webpage is loaded, the user should input the city name that they'd like to search for into the 'city name' search box.  After entering the city name the user should press the blue 'Search City' box.

After pressing the blue 'Search City' button, the current weather as well as the 5 Day Forecast will be loaded onto the webpage.

There is also a list of previously search cities below the 'Search City' button, which can be cleared by pressing the 'clear cities' button.
